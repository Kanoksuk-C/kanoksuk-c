# Hi there, I'm Kanoksuk Chankon ðŸ‘‹
I'm highly interested in data analysis, and I have a strong background in geoinformatics and proven success in leveraging spatial and non-spatial data to drive business decisions. I have completed a [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/4e0a655f9eaf3befdaa66b1bb233ad89) which helped me gain strong theoretical foundations. I am looking for opportunities to further develop my analytical skills through application in a new professional area.

This is a repository to showcase skills and share my example achieved projects in data analytics-related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
### Modeling the Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Rice Cultivation Aree (Paddy Field)
There are 2 objectives of the study, 1) to examine the changes in rice cultivation areas under rainfed and irrigated areas over 2000-2017,
and 2) to model the potential impacts of climate change on rice cultivation areas. 
I managed 2 junior researchers to prepare a time series of climate variables data. 
R programs with biomod2 package were used to perform machine learning (ML) models to project the future climate suitability changes for rice cultivation in the Central Region of Thailand.

**Code:** [Part-1 Biomod2 Rice Import Data.R](https://github.com/Kanoksuk-C/portfolio-projects/blob/1091f461285b1808d308bd371ce757d07b292b93/Part-1_biomod2_rice_import_dataused.R) 
, [Part-2 Biomod2 Rice Models and Forecast.R](https://github.com/Kanoksuk-C/portfolio-projects/blob/1091f461285b1808d308bd371ce757d07b292b93/Part-2_biomod2_rice_Builds_Models.R)

**Skills:** spatial statistics, data cleaning, data manipulation and processing, machine learning, data visualization

**Technology:** R (biomod2, rgdal, raster), Data Query Language (DQL), QGIS

### Land Cover Classification Using Machine Learning Model
This project aims to develop a machine learning (ML) model to classify the high-density area of Bangkok which is challenging with a mix of land use and land cover. 
Sentinel-2 satellite imagery was selected for this study because of good spatial and temporal resolutions compared with other open data. 
I developed the classification model using Google Earth Engine since the availability of time series data and convenient machine learning libraries. 
NDVI was calculated and added to the model to increase the capability of classification.
However, the overall accuracy is not that high due to several challenges eg. spatial resolution limitations. 

**Code:** [GEE Land Cover Classification Using ML.js](https://github.com/Kanoksuk-C/portfolio-projects/blob/1c449d4fcff578e0412b8d6b4728e3b10222a7bf/GEE_Land_Cover_Classification_Using_ML.js)

**Skills:** geospatial data processing, data classification, problem-solving, algorithmic thinking

**Technology:** JavaScript (Google Earth Engine)
