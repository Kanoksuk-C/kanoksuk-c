# Hi there, I'm Kanoksuk Chankon ðŸ‘‹
I'm highly interested in data analysis, and I have a strong background in geoinformatics and proven success in leveraging spatial and non-spatial data to drive business decisions. I have completed a [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/4e0a655f9eaf3befdaa66b1bb233ad89) which helped me gain strong theoretical foundations.

This is a repository to showcase skills and share my achieved projects in data analytics-related topics.
