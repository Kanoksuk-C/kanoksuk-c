# Hi there, I'm Kanoksuk Chankon ðŸ‘‹
I'm highly interested in data analysis, and I have a strong background in geoinformatics and proven success in leveraging spatial and non-spatial data to drive business decisions. I have completed a [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/4e0a655f9eaf3befdaa66b1bb233ad89) which helped me gain strong theoretical foundations. I am looking for opportunities to further develop my analytical skills through application in a new professional area.

This is a repository to showcase skills and share achieved projects in data analytics-related topics.

## Portfolio Projects

### Ride-hailing Trip Value Analysis

Designed and implemented a dashboard to meet executive requirements for a ride-hailing performance report. 
Key objectives addressed include:

- Visualizing ride bookings and completion rates by zone to assess zone performance  Â  
- Analyzing trip value distributions for completed and cancelled trips to understand fare acceptability  Â  
- Providing a breakdown of cancellation reasons by distance range to identify factors affecting cancellations  Â  

The dashboard utilizes boxplots to illustrate trip value distributions and provides detailed breakdowns of bookings and cancellations.

**Code:** [Ride Trip Value Analysis.sql](https://github.com/Kanoksuk-C/portfolio-projects/blob/a7ea35e4b84cf3a6bb8cadc1d31b8f166d02ecfb/Ride%20Trip%20Value%20Analysis.sql) ,

**Skills:** data analysis, data visualization, statistics, spreadsheets, SQL

**Technology:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP), BigQuery, Looker Studio

### Python Implementation for Ride-hailing Fare Equation
The pricing team aimed to model ride-hailing fares using a linear equation based on distance, duration, and a base fare.
To determine the unknown coefficients, I retrieved ride data from BigQuery and employed a Python linear regression model in Google Colab to derive the optimal fare equation.

**Skills:** regression modeling, programming, data analysis, data visualization

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, BigQuery, Google Colab

### Modeling the Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Rice Cultivation Aree (Paddy Field)
This project investigated changes in rice cultivation areas (rainfed and irrigated) from 2000-2017 and modeled the potential impacts of climate change on these areas.
I directed two junior researchers in preparing a time series of climate variable data. 
Machine learning models were then developed using R and the biomod2 package to project future climate suitability changes for rice cultivation in the Central Region of Thailand.

**Code:** [Part-1 Biomod2 Rice Import Data.R](https://github.com/Kanoksuk-C/portfolio-projects/blob/1091f461285b1808d308bd371ce757d07b292b93/Part-1_biomod2_rice_import_dataused.R) 
, [Part-2 Biomod2 Rice Models and Forecast.R](https://github.com/Kanoksuk-C/portfolio-projects/blob/1091f461285b1808d308bd371ce757d07b292b93/Part-2_biomod2_rice_Builds_Models.R)

**Skills:** spatial statistics, data cleaning, data manipulation and processing, machine learning, data visualization

**Technology:** R (biomod2, rgdal, raster), Data Query Language (DQL), QGIS

### Land Cover Classification Using Machine Learning Model

This project developed a machine learning model to classify land cover in Bangkok's challenging high-density areas. 
Sentinel-2 imagery was used due to its high spatial and temporal resolution, and the model was built in Google Earth Engine.
The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated and integrated into the model to improve classification accuracy. 
Despite inherent challenges related to spatial resolution, the project established a workflow for urban land cover classification using advanced remote sensing techniques.

**Code:** [GEE Land Cover Classification Using ML.js](https://github.com/Kanoksuk-C/portfolio-projects/blob/1c449d4fcff578e0412b8d6b4728e3b10222a7bf/GEE_Land_Cover_Classification_Using_ML.js)

**Skills:** geospatial data processing, data classification, confusion matrix, problem-solving, algorithmic thinking

**Technology:** JavaScript (Google Earth Engine), QGIS
